    <font color="black">Hi! This is Christine SUEN. I received my BSc in Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics with first-class honors (Top 1%)
    from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2021. I worked as a research assistant for a year in <a href="https://geoxlab.github.io/">GeoX Lab</a> 
    with <a href="http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/people/academic/liu-xin-tao/index.asp">Dr. Xintao Liu</a> on Digital Twins and 
    collaborated with <a href="http://www.lsgi.polyu.edu.hk/people/academic/yan-wai-yeung/index.asp">Dr Wai Yeung Yan</a> for computer 
    vision-based LiDAR point cloud algorithms development.<br><br>
  I am now a research-based Master's student in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of British Columbia. I
      work with <a href="https://civil.ubc.ca/zhengbo-zou/">Dr. Zhengbo Zou</a> in <a href="https://intelconstructlab.github.io/"> the Intelligent 
    Construction (ICON) lab </a>. I'm trained as a multidisciplinary researcher with a focus on bridging the gap between computer science and construction engineering. 
      My interests include Computer Vision, Machine Learning, LiDAR, Digital Twins, BIM, and construction engineering. Below are some of the projects 
      I've worked on or completed!
