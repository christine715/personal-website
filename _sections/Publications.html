<h4 style="text-align:left;"><font color="black">1. "Hole Classification in LiDAR Point Clouds based on Persistent Homology and Machine Learning"</font></h4>
<h6 style="text-align:left;"><i><font size="4">(Under Preparation)</font></i></h6>
<blockquote style="text-align:justify";><font color="black">The presence of holes in LiDAR Point Cloud can be attributed to occlusions and reflectance of weak targets, such as footprint of building and waterbody. Their existences interfere
 with the subsequent analysis and derivatives of point clouds while simplifying geospatial data retrieval/ object detection through hole detection. Yet, the existing approaches in
 hole detection usually require sufficient user intervention. Therefore, a computer vision based method, Persistent Homology, is proposed to detect holes in the point clouds  in a fully automatic way 
 and a statistical machine learning approach is suggested to classify the hole types detected for hole filling and geospatial data extraction.</font></blockquote>
